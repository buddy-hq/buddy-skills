description: Resource-grounded reading workflow for books, papers, articles, and long-form workspace resources. Use when the learner asks to read, understand, summarize, analyze, close-read, discuss, or study a resource, or when active reading context is present and the request concerns that resource.
---

# Role
Run the reading workflow over the attached resource. Read first, then respond from the text.

# Use When
- the learner wants help reading an attached book, textbook, chapter, paper, or long passage
- the session already has a readable resource and the goal is to work from that source instead of giving generic reading advice

# Default Procedure
1. Inspect the runtime context before giving user-facing guidance:
   - active model limits
   - resource full-text path
   - resource full-text token estimate
2. Decide between `whole-full-text` and `scoped-reading`.
3. If the current native-resource record says `delivery=model-and-resource`, the PDF is already in model context. Do not call `ingest_full_text`; use the prepared pack for citations, navigation, and later scoped reading.
4. Otherwise, if a resource exposes both a full-text path and a full-text token estimate, and the active model exposes an input window or context window, run the headroom test first.
5. Calculate the preliminary full-text budget:
   - `tool_input_window = min(input_window ?? context_window, 250000)`
   - `reserve = clamp(tool_input_window * 0.25, 48000, 96000)`
   - if `tool_input_window - full_text_est_tokens >= reserve`, enter `whole-full-text` mode
   - the ingestion tool performs the final check using live session usage
6. In `whole-full-text` mode, read the entire full-text file before giving any substantive user-facing guidance.
   - if `ingest_full_text` is available, call it
   - pass `resourceKey` as the resource `object_id` or alias
   - let the tool do the live context-budget check before ingestion
   - do this even if the learner asked about a chapter, unless they explicitly want a narrow passage-only reading
   - if the tool succeeds, the full text is now in context and you can respond from it
   - if the tool is unavailable or returns a scoped-reading fallback, continue in `scoped-reading`
7. If the headroom test fails, or the metadata needed for it is unavailable, fall back to `scoped-reading`.
8. In `scoped-reading`, choose one narrow target:
   - one section
   - one chapter
   - one page range
   - one short passage
8. After reading, respond with content grounded in the source:
   - what this text is doing
   - the main structure, major claims, or major themes
   - the next concrete reading move
9. After the learner responds, continue with exactly one next move:
   - explain
   - assess
   - practice

# Grounding Rules
- Treat the source text as the primary source of truth.
- Ground every substantive claim in the text you actually read.
- Distinguish explicitly between:
  1. what the text states
  2. what is a reasonable inference
  3. what requires outside knowledge
- If the text does not support an answer, say so clearly and name what is missing.
- Quote sparingly when exact wording matters; otherwise prefer precise paraphrase.
- When referencing source support, cite section, chapter, heading, page, or passage labels when available.
- Never present inference as if it were explicitly stated.
- If multiple interpretations are plausible, present the strongest candidates and explain why.

# Reading Modes
When the learner's request implies a mode, optimize for it:
- `SUMMARY`: compress without losing the core argument.
- `EXPLANATION`: simplify difficult passages while preserving meaning.
- `ANALYSIS`: identify structure, assumptions, evidence, rhetoric, and implications.
- `CLOSE_READING`: focus on wording, tone, and passage-level meaning.
- `STUDY`: generate checks, prompts, flashcards, memory hooks, and next checkpoints.
- `DISCUSSION`: surface themes, tensions, and debatable interpretations.

# Long-Document Rules
- Maintain awareness of what portion of the document has been seen so far.
- Do not claim document-wide conclusions from a single excerpt unless you label them provisional.
- Keep track of open questions and unresolved threads when useful for continuity.
- If the learner asks about something outside the provided text, state what you still need.

# Response Shape
For substantive reading answers, use this shape when relevant:
1. direct answer
2. support from the text
3. interpretation or implications
4. uncertainty or limits

# Gotchas
- Do not explain the skill, summarize your capabilities, or say what you can do unless the user explicitly asks about the skill itself.
- Do not announce a reading plan before checking whether the whole full text should be read first.
- Do not say you have read the resource unless you have actually used the tool and completed the required reading pass.
- In `whole-full-text` mode, when the ingestion tool is available, the required reading pass means the full-text ingestion tool completed successfully.
- If the whole-full-text rule passes, do not start with TOC-only, chunk-only, or section-only reading.
- If a readable resource is already attached, do not start by asking broad setup questions that delay reading.
- Do not give generic reading advice when you can read the actual source.

# Tool Hints
- When the whole-full-text rule passes and `ingest_full_text` is available, call it before doing anything else substantive.
- When the native-resource record says `delivery=model-and-resource`, do not call `ingest_full_text` for that PDF.
- Pass `resourceKey` copied from `object_id` or `alias` in the resource inventory. Object IDs resolve before aliases.
- The ingestion tool checks live session headroom against its capped input-window budget and returns a scoped-reading fallback when the remaining budget is not large enough.
- If the whole-full-text rule does not pass, use the `pack` path from the resource inventory or tool result, then read/search `10-toc.md`, `chunks/`, `pages/`, or `20-full-text-*.md` under that pack root to stay scoped.
- Use learner state only after you have grounded yourself in the source text.
- If the learner shares the text directly, work from that actual passage instead of generic reading advice.

# Response Rules
- The first substantive response after loading this skill must be about the resource, not about the skill.
- In `whole-full-text` mode, when the ingestion tool is available, do not produce a substantive reading response until `ingest_full_text` succeeds.
- If the ingestion tool succeeds, say that briefly and then move directly into a grounded summary of the book's structure, themes, or argument.
- If you could not read the whole full text, say exactly why in one sentence and then continue with the scoped target you chose.
- After reading, prefer grounded statements about the text over process narration.
- When proposing the next step, give one concrete next move, not a menu of equal options.

# Failure Modes To Avoid
- Hallucinated citations, page numbers, quotes, arguments, or author intent.
- Generic summaries detached from the actual passage.
- Overclaiming from partial context.
- Mixing outside knowledge into text-grounded answers without labeling it.
- Pretending certainty where the text is ambiguous.

# Bad And Good
Bad:
- "I can help you read this book by summarizing, checking understanding, and guiding you section by section."
- "This book seems to have three major parts..." when you have not finished the required reading pass.

Good:
- When the ingestion tool is available, call `ingest_full_text`, wait for it to succeed, then respond with a grounded account of the book.
- "I read the full text. The book is organized into ..."

# Validation Loop
Before responding, check:
1. Did I inspect the runtime context for the full-text headroom rule?
2. If the whole-full-text rule passed and the ingestion tool was available, did `ingest_full_text` succeed before responding?
3. If the whole-full-text rule did not pass, did I read the scoped target I chose?
4. Did I either read the required text or explicitly state why I could not?
5. Is my first real response about the resource rather than about the skill?

# Avoid
- Do not skip the full-text headroom check when the runtime context gives you enough data to make it.
- Do not default to chunk-by-chunk reading when the whole full-text file passes the preliminary capped-window reserve calculation.
- Do not respond with a capability overview when you should already be reading or reporting on the text.
- Do not summarize a whole book before reading it.
- Do not confuse "I started reading" with "I read the book".

# Output
A grounded reading response that proves you have read the relevant source material and moves the learner to the next concrete step.
