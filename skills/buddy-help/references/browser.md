# Browser

Use when the user asks about Buddy's in-app Browser, web tabs, profiles, Incognito, opening links in Buddy, or citing a webpage. Desktop app only. ChatGPT and MCP sign-in use the **system browser** (`providers.md`, `extend.md`).

## Open and use

- Sidebar **Browser** opens a blank Browser tab on the Bench using the default profile.
- On a Bench **New tab** page (**+** or **Cmd/Ctrl+T**): the **Browser** tile opens a blank Browser tab in the default profile, and its ▾ menu opens one in any profile, **Incognito** included. Typing a profile name or **incognito** offers the same choice. Typing a URL or search terms offers to open it in Browser with the default profile, next to matching Recently visited pages (`workspace.md`).
- Ask Buddy to open an HTTP or HTTPS page and it can present a new Browser tab. Buddy can also switch the Bench back to a Browser tab that is already open. The page is controlled by the user: Buddy cannot inspect, click, type, scroll, or screenshot the live Browser tab.
- The tab has Back, Forward, Reload, an address/search field, and **More**. A blank Browser tab shows search and **Recently visited** pages from this notebook (not the same as the Bench **New tab** page).
- **More** offers hard reload, zoom, page Appearance, clear cookies, and clear cache. The ↗ button at the end of the address bar opens the page in your default browser.
- Select page text → **Cite selected text**, or use **Cite in Chat** from the page menu, to put a web quote in the chat composer. Clicking a saved quote tries to reopen and highlight the passage.

The Browser is available on the desktop app. A web build says **Browser requires Buddy desktop**.

## Where links open

**Settings → Browser → Links** sets where web links in chats, Markdown documents, PDFs, and books open: **Click a link** for a plain click, and **Cmd-click a link** (**Ctrl-click a link** on Windows and Linux) for a Cmd/Ctrl+click. Each is **Default browser** or **Buddy** (a new Browser tab on the Bench). Initially, a click uses your default browser and a Cmd/Ctrl+click opens Buddy.

- The first eligible click may ask **Open links in Buddy?** Choose **Use default browser** or **Open in Buddy**. Change the choice in Settings later.
- Changing **Click a link** to the value **Cmd-click a link** already has swaps the two, so Cmd/Ctrl+click still reaches the other destination. Choosing **Open in Buddy** in the prompt does the same.
- Links Buddy's Browser cannot open, and any click when the Browser is unavailable, still use the system browser.
- Inside a Browser page, **Cmd/Ctrl+click** and links the page opens in a new tab open a new Browser tab on the Bench with the same profile, whatever these settings say; Settings shows this as a fixed **New Buddy tab** row. To send one of those links to the system browser instead, right-click it and choose **Open Link in Default Browser**.
- Provider and MCP sign-in, and **Open in default browser**, use the system browser regardless of this setting.

## Profiles and defaults

- **Settings → Browser → Profiles** separates cookies and logins. **Default** is built in. Add a blank profile or import cookies from Chrome, Edge, or Safari; the source browser may need to be closed for import.
- **Incognito** is opened from the New tab page (**Browser** ▾ menu, or type **incognito**), not the Settings profile list. Its data is cleared when Buddy closes, and its visits do not appear in Recently visited.
- A profile menu can **Set as default**, **Clear cookies and cache**, or remove a custom profile and its data. Already open tabs in a removed profile stay open until closed.
- **Settings → Browser → Defaults** controls search engine, zoom for new tabs, and page Appearance. Browser Appearance tells web pages which color scheme to prefer; the app theme is under Settings → Appearance.

## Limits and gotchas

- Browser tabs are not restored after Buddy restarts. Recently visited pages are kept per notebook on this machine.
- Browser tabs accept HTTP and HTTPS pages. Other address types and links that try to open another app can be blocked.
- There is no Browser downloads list; camera and microphone are unavailable in Browser.
- Buddy can separately search or fetch the web when that capability is used, but opening a page in Browser does not give Buddy the live tab contents.
